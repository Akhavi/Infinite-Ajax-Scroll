h1. Infinite Ajax Scroll

Turn your paginated pages into infinite scrolling pages with ease.

Version 0.1.2-farooq

Requires jQuery 1.4 or newer.

h2. Requirements

* jQuery 1.4+
* A fully working (server-side) pagination with a 'goto the next page' link

IAS is based on the assumption that you, as a developer, already have taken care for the pagination using a server-side script. What IAS does is loading the next page via AJAX and inserting each individual item into the current page.

h2. Installation

To install Infinite Ajax Scroll make sure you have jQuery 1.4+ installed. Next, add jquery.ias.min.js to the head of your webpage.

bc. <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.ias.min.js"></script>

Now place the loader image in you image folder and add the CSS to you existing stylesheets.

h2. Basic usage

bc. my_ias = jQuery.ias({
	container : ".listing",
	item: ".post",
	pagination: "#content .navigation",
	next: ".next-posts a",
	loader: "images/loader.gif"
	firstPage: "first_page.php"
});

You can use IAS multiple times within a single webpage. For example, you can have an IAS definition for paginating blogposts and one for comments.

h2. Options

h3. container

*Default:* "#container"
Enter the selector of the element containing your items that you want to paginate.

h3. item

Enter the selector of the element that contains your regular pagination links, like next, previous and the page numbers. This element will be hidden when IAS loads.

h3. next

*Default:* ".next"
Enter the selector of the link element that links to the next page. The href attribute of this element will be used to get the items from the next page.

h3. loader

*Default:* "images/loader.gif"
Enter the url to the loader image. This image will be displayed when the next page with items is loaded via AJAX.

h3. onPageChange

*Default:* empty function
Event handler. Is called each time the user scrolls to an other page.

Parameters:

|*param*|*description*|
|pageNum|Current page number|

Example:

bc. onPageChange: function(pageNum, pageUrl, scrollOffset) { console.log('Welcome on page ' + pageNum); } 

h3. firstPage

*Default:* false
Can be used to let IAS load the first page results via AJAX.

h2. Methods

h3. prepandPage

Parameters:

|*param*|*description*|
|url|Url to page with item to load|

Can be used to let IAS load the a page with updated items results via AJAX and prepend them in the page.

Example:

bc. my_ias.prependPage("update_page.php"); 


h2. Customizing

IAS inserts a div element with a image to generate a loader. The div has a class called *ias_loader*. Using this class you can adjust the styling of the loader.

You can also link to an other loader image. Use the *loader* option to link to the right image.
