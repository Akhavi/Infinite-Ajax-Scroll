h1. 0.1.1 / 2011-06-14

This version adds two major enhancements: a paging module and a history module. The paging module now only gives you the onPageChange callback function and deep linking, but will serve as a base for future updates. You can use the onPageChange callback function to take action when a user scrolls to a certain page. The history module remembers the last page the user was on before clicking on a link. When the user hits the back button, IAS will automatically load the pages up to the last page and automatically scrolls to that page.
